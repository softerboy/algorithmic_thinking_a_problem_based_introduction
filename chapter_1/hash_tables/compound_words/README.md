# Problem 2: _Compound Words_

### The problem

We are given a wordlist in which each word is a lowercase string. For example, we might be given the wordlist containing
`crea`, `create`, `open`, and `tea`. We'll assume that the strings aren't very long. Our task is to determine the
strings in the wordlist that are _`compound words`_: the concatenation of exactly two other strings in the wordlist. For
the given example, only the string `create` is such a compound word, because it is the concatenation of `crea` and `te`.
    

---
#### Input
The input is one string (word) pre line, in alphabetical order. We'll get at most 120,000 strings.

---
#### Output
The problem requires us to output each compound word on its own line, in alphabetical order.
